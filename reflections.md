Due to this project, I have learned how incredibly useful generative AI is. This has been within my sphere for a while, but just playing around with the responses makes me so excited for the collabortion between humans and computers. My set up was incredibly fast complimented by an extremely simple documentation, I was well on my way to developing my own program. I had always assumed that AI was locked behind so many doors, but this assignment has really opened up my eyes on how accessible it is.
