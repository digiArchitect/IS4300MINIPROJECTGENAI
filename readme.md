Hello!
This is my generative AI program using googles generative ai.
After installing google's genAI, I simply needed to import it, apply my key (hiding it using environ), and then create a function. This function would call a question to the AI and print out the response.

All you would need to run is it installing google-genai and then putting your own api key!

For my reflections, read reflections.md.

Thank you!
